## Overview

### Intro

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)- Typescript Documentation
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)- Redux Library
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)- Firebase Firestore Database
- [Formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview)- Formik Form management Library
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/) - Framer Motion Animation Library


### What I learned

This is my first time, using Typescript and most of the libraries I used on this Project, like formik, Firebase, Redux. So it was a challenging journey, with the way I scalled the app.



### Continued development

- There will be another version of this app. Where I will be developing the backend myself with NodeJs and Express Js, Because Firestore might shut down because I'm using a free plan.
- Implement features like Authentication and Authorization.
